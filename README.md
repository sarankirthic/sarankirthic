Hi, Welcom to my Github. I am Sarankirthic SP and I am an engineer. I am interested in fields of science, programming and cybersecurity. Science is so beautiful which helps us understand the world aroud us. Programming on the other hand helps us implement these concepts and visualise the phenomenon. A cool aspect of programming is automation. Any process can be automated and scaled either to do a particular task or to analyse or to protect or attain information continuously, which is a very engaging and amusing.

Learning penetration testing, ethical hacking by competing in CTFs. Also learning docker and application development simltaneously. Researching on Blockchaing, Cyber Attack vectors, battery management system and Decentralization. Working on few personal projects that involves DeOps, Application developement and Web Development. Also working with Ydealogy to create a security feature for traditional wifi systems. 

I am proficient in Python, Web Development ....

U can't reach me, unless I want you to. That sounds sus. Just kidding. If you want to talk to me you will have to solve a very simple puzzle. Just find the flag in this [file](https://github.com/sarankirthic/tcatnoC_eM).
