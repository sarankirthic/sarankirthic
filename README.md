Hi! Welcome to my Github. I am Sarankirthic SP and I am an engineer interested in fields of science, programming and cybersecurity. Science is so beautiful, soo beautiful that it helps us understand the world aroud us. Programming on the other hand helps us implement these concepts and visualise the phenomenon. A cool aspect of programming is automation. 

Any process can be automated and scaled either to do a particular task or to analyse or to protect or attain information continuously, which is a very engaging and amusing. Automation can be a powerful tool for streamlining processes and allowing for more efficient data analysis and protection. 

Learning penetration testing, ethical hacking by competing in CTFs. As an Application developer trying to solve many real life problems. Researching on Blockchaing, Cyber Attack vectors, battery management system and Decentralization. Working on few personal projects that involves DeOps, Application developement and Web Development. I am proficient in Python and Web Application Development.
