Hi! Welcome to my Github. I am  Sarankirthic SP, and I am an engineer interested in designing efficient backend systems, 
building scalable web applications, and exploring the possibilities of modern software engineering. I enjoy transforming 
ideas into practical solutions through clean code, structured design, and strong fundamentals. My passion lies in 
blending engineering logic with creativity to solve problems and make technology more accessible. 

My technical expertise covers a diverse range of tools and frameworks. I work with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, 
and **Python** to build backend systems, using **Flask** for lighter web services when needed. For data management, 
I rely on relational databases like **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**, along with non-relational options such as **MongoDB**. 
To ensure scalability and reliability, I incorporate **Docker**, **Maven**, and industry-standard development practices, 
focusing on security, performance, and maintainability throughout.  

Beyond development, my interests extend to exploring **system design**, **cloud-native applications**, and 
**privacy-focused technologies**. I enjoy working on projects that blend these skills to deliver enterprise-grade 
solutions while continuing to learn and adapt to modern trends in the software ecosystem. This GitHub showcases my 
journey through backend engineering, database management, and system deployment, representing my commitment to solving 
complex challenges with clarity and precision.  

### Current Focus Areas  
- Microservices architecture and API development  
- Automation of system deployment and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)  
- Enhancing application security and data privacy  
- Cloud-native solutions and container orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes
